In this project, I worked on predicting customer churn using machine learning.
I started by understanding the dataset and performing data cleaning and
preprocessing. Categorical features were encoded and irrelevant columns
were removed. I then trained a Logistic Regression model and evaluated its
performance using an 80:20 train-test split.

The final model achieved approximately 82% accuracy and is able to predict
both churn outcome and churn probability for individual customers.
